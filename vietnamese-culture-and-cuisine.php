			<p><img class="image" src="/images/vietnamese-culture-and-cuisine/vietnamese-culture-and-cuisine.gif" width="240" height="180" alt="Vietnamese culture and cuisine." align="right" />Throughout the country, there are three important qualities to Vietnamese cuisine: <b>freshness</b>, <b>lightness</b> and <b>flavour</b>.</p>
			<p>Vietnam’s historical influences and geographical shifts have created a cuisine rich in variety and vibrant in colour and freshness. It is a long skinny country stretching from Hanoi and the Red River in the north to Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and the fertile Mekong River Delta in the south. On the west, Vietnam is bordered by Laos and Cambodia, and to the north lies China.</p>
			<p>The food to the North, through stir fries and noodle based soups, shows the heavy infl uence of Chinese cooking. Colder climate limits the variety of spices and produce that is available, and as a result, the food is lighter and less spicy-hot than the Centre and South regions. The mountainous Centre, where Hue, the ancient capital of Vietnames Kings, features a highly decorative, spicy cuisine, reflecting the pleasures of the country’s royalty and the abundance of spices the region’s mountainous terrain affords.</p>
			<p>The South is tropical, sustaining rice paddies, coconut groves, and its fertile earth makes it ideal for growing a large variety of vegetables, fruit and livestock. Given the vast areas of shoreline here, seafood is a natural staple for people in the South.</p>
			<p>As in the rest of Southeast Asia, there is an ancient layer of Indian cultural presence, most obviously seen in the religion of Buddhism (which during the first millenium made its way along the Silk Road from India to East Asia). In addition, Southern Vietnam was once a common stop for Indian traders before there journey back west, and they left a taste for curried dishes behind. The French influence in Vietnam from the 16th century to the middle of the 20th century, is also reflected deeply in Vietnamese cooking: the French introduced the baguette, white potatoes, asparagus, tarragon and shallots to this region, and they are still grown and consumed today.</p>
			<p>Vietnam’s culinary heritage combines elements from all these celebrated cuisines. These influences have given food a tremendous palette of fl avours, textures and colours.</p>
			
			<h2>A Cuisine of Dipping Sauces and Fresh Ingredients</h2>
			<p><img class="image" src="/images/ui/dummy-240x180.gif" width="240" height="180" alt="Image missing!" align="right" />Vietnamese food is famous for its various and light dipping sauces which accompany practically all dishes. The food offered on the plates would not be the same without the tiny bowls and cuplets jointly presented.</p>
			
			<h3>Fish Sauce or Nuoc Mam</h3>
			<p>This quintessential sauce, a liquid extraction made from fermented fish and salt, is used to season almost every Vietnamese dish. It is used to salt and enhance as well as to make other dipping sauces, such as the popular Nuoc Cham Sauce, made with diluted fi sh sauce, lemon juice, garlic, shallots and chilli.</p>
			
			<h3>Special Dipping Sauce or Nuoc Tuong</h3>
			<p>This sharp tasting sauce, made from whole or crushed fermented soybeans, is used to season stir-fries and make sauces. This basic sauce, when combined with hoisin sauce, yellow mung beans, and topped with ground peanuts, becomes a dipping sauce to accompany the famous Summer Rolls (Goi Cuon).</p>
			
			<h3>Fragrant Herbs or Rau thom</h3>
			<p>The Vietnamese live to eat large quantities of herbs. A family meal often consists of a table salad, which often includes lettuce and varieties of mint and basil. To eat, people simply snip off the sprigs and add to their bowls or plates, creating mini salads. Fresh herbs are also used as garnishes and accompaniments to soups, salads, and noodle dishes.</p>
				
			<h2>...and of a Variety of Rice and Noodles</h2>
			<p><img class="image" src="/images/ui/dummy-240x180.gif" width="240" height="180" alt="Image missing!" align="right" />Vietnamese cuisine is also rich in the variety of rice and noodles, made from different types of rice grains and rice flour. These noodles are low in calories and light in texture.</p>
			
			<h3>Steamed White Rice</h3>
			<p>Vietnamese prefer the long grained jasmine variety, called Gao Thom, meaning fragrant rice. For the best flavour, the rice is served piping hot immediately after it is fi nished cooking.</p>
			
			<h3>Rice Vermicelli or Bun</h3>
			<p>These are small, wiry noodles and are frequently used in noodle salads, soups and dry noodle dishes such as our Bun Cha Hanoi or Bun Bo Xao. More fragile than pasta, they require little cooking time. In Vietnamese markets they are sold fresh: sticky, moist and ready to eat.</p>
			
			<h3>Rice Flour or Bot Gao</h3>
			<p>This is the most common starch in Vietnamese cooking, not to be confused with glutinous rice fl our. It is made from short-grained rice and used to make sweet as well as savoury noodles, crepes, dumplings and cakes.</p>
			
			<h3>Rice Paper or Banh Trang</h3>
			<p>Thin wrappers made from rice fl our sometimes in combination with tapioca starch, salt and water, and sun-dried on bamboo trays, which give them their distinctive pattern. They come in square, circular and triangular shapes and are used to wrap Summer Rolls (Goi Cuon) or Spring Rolls (Cha Gio).</p>
			
			<h3>Rice Sticks or Banh Pho</h3>
			<p>These flatter and wider noodles come in several widths and are used in the celebration Pho Soup and various stir-fries.</p>
			
			<h2>Introducing Vietnam’s Most Popular Dishes</h2>
			<p><img class="image" src="/images/ui/dummy-240x180.gif" width="240" height="180" alt="Image missing!" align="right" />Now you can sample some of Vietnam’s famous dishes, renowned for their exquisite fl avours, sumptuous lightness and the frshness of their ingredients, Vietnam is a nation obsessed with eating, so take a journey with us through our gastyronomic delights!</p>
			
			<h3>A Culture of Soups at all hours of the Day</h3>
			<p>The famous Beef Noodle Soup (Pho Bo) begins with boiling-hot beef stock poured over fresh rice noodles and paper thin slices of raw beef or larger chunks of cooked beef in a bowl. After ‘drowning’ the beef to ensure that it is cooked, fresh raw bean sprouts, onion, green chilli peppers, lemon juice and coriander, basil and mint leaves are added and mixed just before eating. Careful with the chiili peppers - they are for fl avouring and they are not to be eaten directly!</p>
			
			<h3>Noodles and Vermicelli, well Mixed, Please</h3>
			<p>Grilled Pork on a Bed of Rice Vermicelli (Bun Thit Nuong) is a classic example of the delightful combination of cold fresh noodles topped with shredded lettuce, vegetables, Vietnamese herbs and grilled meat. Pork is the main meat used in this dish, but grilled beef, chicken and shrimp are just as delicious. Nuoc Cham Sauce and roasted peanuts are traditionally passed around the table so each diner can season and mix his own bowl as desired.</p>
			
			<h3>Light and Delicious Rolls and Crepes</h3>
			<p>Saigon Summer Rolls (Goi Cuon) are a favourite for a light but fl avourful snack or as an appetizer. A Vietnamese salad with pork and shrimp rolled in soft rice pappers, it offers a refreshing tinge to the palette with its aromatic herbs. The sound of the Crispy Sizzling Crepe (Banh Xeo) when the batter is poured into the skillet is what lends the name to this Southern favourite dish. “Xeo” means “Sound”. This is traditionally gathered up by the diner, dipped in Nuoc Cham, and eaten by hand.</p>
			
			<h3>Flavourful Salads</h3>
			<p>The Green Papaya Salad (Goi Du Du) is a refreshing salad with tangy, sweet and spicy characteristics perfect with any barbecued meat, or as an appetizer. The main ingredient, green papaya, has dark green skin and light green fl esh, and is used as a vegetable because unlike the orange coloured papaya, it is mild and crunchy, not sweet.</p>
			
			<h2>Vegetarian a la Vietnamese</h2>
			<p><img class="image" src="/images/ui/dummy-240x180.gif" width="240" height="180" alt="Image missing!" align="right" />If it is the 1st, 14th, 15th or 30th day of the lunar month, many Vietnamese eat vegetarian, called chay. By adstaining from meat on these sacred days, they reaffirm their belief in the teachings of Buddha. However, when Vietnamese eat vegetarian for religious reasons, they still require all the flavour and freshness of the cooking. In Vietnam, vegetarian food is highly regarded and requires great skill and innovation to select and prepare the ingredients, of which tofu and mushroom are the mainstay.</p>
